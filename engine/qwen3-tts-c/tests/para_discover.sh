# PARA DISCOVERY (user 2026-06-26, strada 2): find which paralinguistics the MODEL can emit NATIVELY
# (= cross-voice for free) via the right TRIGGER. Hypothesis (why "hahaha" worked): onomatopoeia spelled
# AS THE SOUND get PERFORMED, words get READ. Sweep many spell-as-sound triggers (Latin + Chinese +
# Japanese) + a strong EN instruct, on ryan (discovery voice). Winners -> later cross-voice + steer-extract.
#   -> samples/para_discover/   (one subfolder per event)
