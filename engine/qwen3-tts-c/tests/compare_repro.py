"""compare_repro.py — server-reproducibility gate with an fp-noise tolerance.

The old gate was raw md5 equality. That is the WRONG oracle for this engine
(same reason test-golden uses mel-corr, not md5): the decode path carries a
known, benign ±1–2 LSB int16 jitter (≈ −90 dB, fp accumulation order — e.g.
threaded snake / BLAS internals), measured 2026-07-11 at ~0.05% of samples
with IDENTICAL length and codec codes. What this test must actually catch is
STATE LEAKING between requests: different lengths (trajectory fork), or
sample deviations beyond LSB noise.

PASS  = all runs: identical sample count, max |diff| <= MAX_LSB,
        differing samples <= MAX_FRAC.
