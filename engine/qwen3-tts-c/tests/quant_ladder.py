"""
quant_ladder.py — per-codebook argmax-agreement matrix across CP precisions.

Reads code-dump files produced by QWEN_DUMP_CODES (one line per audio frame:
"code0 c1 c2 ... c15" — 16 codebook tokens). Each file is one CP precision; the
Talker is held at bf16 across all of them (QWEN_CP_PREC), so code0 is identical
run-to-run and any disagreement in c1..c15 is PURE Code-Predictor quantization
drift — exactly the "where/how-much does int4 drift vs int8/bf16" question from
PLAN.md future-research C.

Usage:
    quant_ladder.py bf16:bf16.codes int8:int8.codes int4:int4.codes q2:q2.codes

The FIRST file is the reference (normally bf16 = the gold). Reports:
  * overall agreement of each precision vs the reference (codebooks 1..15)
  * per-codebook-index agreement (which residuals diverge FIRST)
  * the int4-vs-int8 pair explicitly (int8 is the artifact-free gold; this
    quantifies the slight "aggression" int4 introduces)
